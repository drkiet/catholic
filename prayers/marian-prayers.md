## The Magnificat


The Prayer Of Mary

  My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
  my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
  for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
  From this day all generations will call me blessed:
  the Almighty has done great things for me,
  and holy is his Name.

  He has mercy on those who fear him
  in every generation.
  He has shown the strength of his arm,
  he has scattered the proud in their conceit.

  He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
  and has lifted up the lowly.
  He has filled the hungry with good things,
  and the rich he has sent away empty.

  He has come to the help of his servant Israel
  for he remembered his promise of mercy,
  the promise he made to our fathers,
  to Abraham and his children forever.

  (Lk 1: 46-55)

  Magnificat anima mea Dominum;
  Et exultavit spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo,
  Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae; ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes.
  Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est, et sanctum nomen ejus, Et misericordia ejus a progenie in progenies timentibus eum.
  Fecit potentiam brachio suo;
  Dispersit superbos mente cordis sui.
  Deposuit potentes de sede, et exaltavit humiles.
  Esurientes implevit bonis, et divites dimisit inanes.
  Sucepit Israel, puerum suum, recordatus misericordiae suae, Sicut locutus est ad patres nostros, Abraham et semeni ejus in saecula.
