## The Magnificat


  The Prayer Of Mary  

  My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,  
  my spirit rejoices in God my Savior  
  for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.  
  From this day all generations will call me blessed:  
  the Almighty has done great things for me,  
  and holy is his Name.  

  He has mercy on those who fear him  
  in every generation.  
  He has shown the strength of his arm,  
  he has scattered the proud in their conceit.  

  He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,  
  and has lifted up the lowly.  
  He has filled the hungry with good things,  
  and the rich he has sent away empty.  

  He has come to the help of his servant Israel  
  for he remembered his promise of mercy,  
  the promise he made to our fathers,  
  to Abraham and his children forever.  

  (Lk 1: 46-55)  

  Magnificat anima mea Dominum;  
  Et exultavit spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo,  
  Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae;
  ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes.
  Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est,
  et sanctum nomen ejus,

  Et misericordia ejus a progenie in progenies timentibus eum.  
  Fecit potentiam brachio suo;  
  Dispersit superbos mente cordis sui.  
  Deposuit potentes de sede, et exaltavit humiles.  
  Esurientes implevit bonis, et divites dimisit inanes.  
  Sucepit Israel, puerum suum, recordatus misericordiae suae, Sicut locutus est ad patres nostros, Abraham et semeni ejus in saecula.  


## The Memorare

  Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.

  Amen.

## Don Bosco's Prayer to Mary
Authored By: St. John Bosco

Most Holy Virgin Mary, Help of Christians,  
how sweet it is to come to your feet  
imploring your perpetual help.  
If earthly mothers cease not to remember their children,   
how can you, the most loving of all mothers forget me?  
Grant then to me, I implore you,  
your perpetual help in all my necessities,  
in every sorrow, and especially in all my temptations.  
I ask for your unceasing help for all who are now suffering.  
 Help the weak, cure the sick, convert sinners.  
Grant through your intercessions many vocations to the religious life.  
Obtain for us, O Mary, Help of Christians,  
that having invoked you on earth we may love and eternally thank you in heaven.  


Fr. Don Bosco was a dedicated priest who took on blood-thirsty revolutionaries, the Italian government and his own archbishop in his quest to rescue the homeless children of Turin. This heroic priest’s undying belief in the boys he sought to help inspired them to fulfill their potential in the Catholic Faith. Don Bosco’s lifelong effort to save the children of the street became the foundation of the Salesians, one of the largest child care networks in the world.



## An Election Prayer to Mary

O Most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy, at this most critical time, we entrust the United States of America to your loving care.

Most Holy Mother, we beg you to reclaim this land for the glory of your Son. Overwhelmed with the burden of the sins of our nation, we cry to you from the depths of our hearts and seek refuge in your motherly protection.

Look down with mercy upon us and touch the hearts of our people. Open our minds to the great worth of human life and to the responsibilities that accompany human freedom.

Free us from the falsehoods that lead to the evil of abortion and threaten the sanctity of family life. Grant our country the wisdom to proclaim that God’ s law is the foundation on which this nation was founded, and that He alone is the True Source of our cherished rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

O Merciful Mother, give us the courage to reject the culture of death and the strength to build a new Culture of Life.


## A Prayer in Honor of the Immaculate Conception

ANT. This is the rod in which was neither knot of original sin,
nor rind of actual guilt.

V. In thy conception, O Virgin! Thou wast immaculate.

R. Pray for us to the Father, Whose Son thou didst bring forth.

Let us Pray

O GOD, Who, by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, didst
prepare a worthy habitation for Thy Son, we beseech Thee, that as
by the foreseen death of that same Son, Thou didst preserve her
from all stain, so too thou wouldst permit us, purified through
her intercession, to come unto Thee. Through the same Christ our
Lord. Amen.

Prayer to Our Lady Immaculate

Most holy Virgin, who wast pleasing to the Lord and became His
Mother, immaculate in body and spirit, in faith and in love, look
kindly on the wretched who implore thy powerful patronage. The
wicked serpent, against whom was hurled the first curse, continues
fiercely to attack and ensnare the unhappy children of Eve. Do
thou, then, O Blessed Mother, our queen and advocate, who from the
first instant of thy conception didst crush the head of the enemy,
receive the prayers which, united with thee in our single heart,
we implore thee to present at the throne of God, that we may never
fall into the snares which are laid out for us, and may all arrive
at the port of salvation; and, in so many dangers, may the Church
and Christian society sing once again the hymn of deliverance and
of victory and of peace. Amen.

Ejaculations

In Thy conception, O Virgin Mary, thou wast immaculate; pray for
us to the Father, Whose Son, Jesus Christ conceived of the Holy
Ghost, thou didst bring forth.



## A Prayer to Our Lady of Guadalupe

Our Lady of Guadalupe,  
Mystical Rose,  
make intercession for holy Church,  
protect the sovereign Pontiff,  
help all those who invoke you in their necessities,  
and since you are the ever Virgin Mary  
and Mother of the true God,  
obtain for us from your most holy Son  
the grace of keeping our faith,  
of sweet hope in the midst of the bitterness of life  
of burning charity, and the precious gift  
of final perseverance.  

Amen.


## Our Lady of Perpetual Help

O Mother of Perpetual Help, grant that I may ever invoke thy most powerful name, which is the safeguard of the living and the salvation of the dying. O Purest Mary, O Sweetest Mary, let thy name henceforth be ever on my lips. Delay not, O Blessed Lady, to help me whenever I call on thee, for, in all my needs, in all my temptations I shall never cease to call on thee, ever repeating thy sacred name, Mary, Mary.

O what consolation, what sweetness, what confidence, what emotion fill my soul when I pronounce thy sacred name, or even only think of thee. I thank God for having given thee, for my good, so sweet, so powerful, so lovely a name. But I will not be content with merely pronouncing thy name: let my love for thee prompt me ever to hail thee, Mother of Perpetual Help.


## A Prayer of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary
Authored By: Pope John Paul II

1. 'Hail Mary, full of grace! '  
Immaculate Virgin, here I am at your feet once again,  
full of devotion and gratitude.  
I return to this historic Piazza di Spagna  
on the solemn day of your feast  
to pray for the beloved city of Rome,  
for the Church, for the whole world.  
In you, 'humble and highest of creatures',  
divine grace had the full victory over evil.  
You are for us, pilgrims on the paths of the world,  
the bright model of evangelical fidelity  
and the ever-living pledge of sure hope.  

2. Virgin Mother, 'Salvation of the Roman People! '  
Watch over, I pray you, the beloved Diocese of Rome:  
over pastors and faithful, parishes and religious communities.  
Watch over families especially:  
may love sealed by the Sacrament ever reign between spouses,  
may children walk on the paths of goodness and true freedom,  
may the elderly feel surrounded by attention and affection.  
Inspire, Mary, in so many young hearts,  
generous replies to the 'call for the mission',  
a subject on which the diocese has  
been reflecting over the years.  
Thanks to an intense pastoral program for vocations,  
may Rome be enriched by new young forces,  
dedicated with enthusiasm to proclaiming the Gospel  
in the city and in the world.  

3. Blessed Virgin, Queen of Apostles!  
Assist those who through study  
and prayer are preparing to labor  
on the many frontiers of the new evangelization.  
Today I entrust to you, in a special way,  
the community of the Pontifical Urban College,  
whose historic headquarters are located in front of this pillar.  
May this wonderful institution founded 375 years ago  
by Pope Urban VIII for the formation of missionaries,  
be able to continue effectively its ecclesial service.  
May those it gathers, seminarians and priests,  
men and women religious and laity,  
be ready to put their energies at the disposition  
of Christ in service of the Gospel to the far corners of the globe.  

4. 'Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us! '  
Pray, O Mother, for all of us.  
Pray for humanity for those who suffers poverty and injustice,  
violence and hatred, terror and war.  
Help us to contemplate with the rosary  
the mysteries of Him who 'is our peace',  
so that we will all feel involved  
in a persevering dedication of service to peace.  
Look with special attention  
upon the land in which you gave birth to Jesus,  
a land that you loved together with Him,  
and that is still so sorely tried today.  
Pray for us, Mother of hope!  
'Give us days of peace, watch over our way.  
Let us see your Son as we rejoice in heaven'. Amen!  

Prayer by Pope John Paul II on the Second Sunday of Advent, 8 December 2002 . Given at Piazza di Spagna  


## Pope John Paul II's Prayer to Our Lady of Lourdes
Authored By: Pope John Paul II

Hail Mary, poor and humble Woman, Blessed by the Most High! Virgin of hope, dawn of a new era, We join in your song of praise, to celebrate the Lord’ s mercy, to proclaim the coming of the Kingdom and the full liberation of humanity.

Hail Mary, lowly handmaid of the Lord, Glorious Mother of Christ! Faithful Virgin, holy dwelling-place of the Word, Teach us to persevere in listening to the Word, and to be docile to the voice of the Spirit, attentive to his promptings in the depths of our conscience and to his manifestations in the events of history.

Hail Mary, Woman of sorrows, Mother of the living! Virgin spouse beneath the Cross, the new Eve, Be our guide along the paths of the world. Teach us to experience and to spread the love of Christ, to stand with you before the innumerable crosses on which your Son is still crucified.

Hail Mary, woman of faith, First of the disciples! Virgin Mother of the Church, help us always to account for the hope that is in us, with trust in human goodness and the Father’ s love. Teach us to build up the world beginning from within: in the depths of silence and prayer, in the joy of fraternal love, in the unique fruitfulness of the Cross.

Holy Mary, Mother of believers, Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us.

Amen.

This prayer was said during the Holy Father's August 15, 2004 visit to Lourdes, France. The Pope asked her among other things to 'be our guide along the paths of the world. '
