# The prayers after receiving communion

## The Anima Christi
  Soul of Christ, sanctify me;
  Body of Christ, save me;
  Blood of Christ, inebriate me;
  Water from the side of Christ, wash me;
  Passion of Christ, strengthen me;
  O good Jesus hear me;
  Within your wounds hide me;
  separated from you, let me never be;
  From the evil one protect me;
  At the hour of my death, call me;
  And close to you bid me; That with your saints,
  I may be praising you forever and ever.

  Amen.
